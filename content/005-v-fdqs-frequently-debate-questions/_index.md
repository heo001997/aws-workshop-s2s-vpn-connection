1. Why don’t we trigger save on each Notion page changes?
⇒ Notion doesn’t support this kind of trigger, and I found no other workaround like this.
2. Images like Thumbnail and Favicon how can I change it?
⇒ Check this part “IV. Level 3 - Notion to Hugo Relearn (on Github Pages)” → “5. (Optional) Add thumbnail & favicon”
3. I don’t want each Heading will create a page, how can I do?
⇒ It will always create a page per Heading. You can avoid creating page by using anything Notion block other than Heading, such as: Bullet, Text…
4. Why don’t we have more configurations?
⇒ This is the side project when I’m doing my AWS First Cloud Journey course, so I don’t have much time for these, everything packed within a week. I expect to use this tool for myself to be honest, so this is enough for me.
5. I want to contribute features, is this opensource?
⇒ Yes, this project is completely opensource and you’re very [welcome to contribute here](https://github.com/heo001997/notion-to-markdown).
6. Is my credentials safe?
⇒ Completely safe, we don’t save any of your credentials, you can double check our codebase if you need it.
7. Bugs where can I report it? How can I fix it?
⇒ You’re [welcome open an issue here](https://github.com/heo001997/notion-to-markdown). Or you can give it your PR to fix the problem.
8. Can’t you see that the code looks pretty shit?
⇒ You tell me, that’s everything I can do with AI coder, create this workshop, setup everything in a week. You can refactor it for me if you want, or make a fork.
