Applaud mentor Gia Hung and his First Cloud Journey team for an excellent Site-to-Site VPN workshop.
Inheriting that spirit, we will have a similar journey focused on Site-to-Site VPN but with fewer VPCs, Subnets, and EC2 instances.
We will provide an easier perspective for newcomers, focusing only on Site-to-Site VPN with the most cost-effective setup possible.
Each piece of information is presented in bite-sized portions, making it easy to keep up with the guide without falling behind.
