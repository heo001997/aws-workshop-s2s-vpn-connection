Basically, we can use any existed Hugo Relearn repository, because this will only sync Notion page to 2 directories `content` and `static` in the repo.


Or you can use [my premade skeleton-aws-workshop repository](https://github.com/heo001997/skeleton-aws-workshop), I’ve optimized the theme by fixing some UI/UX bugs, styling, and Github workflow file  match my needs.


In this part, I’ll use [GitHub import on that repo](https://github.com/new/import) to my [new Notion To Markdown repository](https://github.com/heo001997/aws-workshop-notion-to-md)

It’s done now, you can update your README and About if you want
