To run the GitHub Action for auto CI/CD, we need to setup a workflow file.


Basically I’ve set it up in my skeleton repo, so my repo workflow file should working correctly without any changes.


I also fix the bug “lost custom domain when deploy with GitHub Action”.


You can see the [latest file right here](https://github.com/heo001997/aws-workshop-notion-to-md/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml).


Add this file in your project with path `.github/workflows/hugo.yaml` with the latest content like my file, your GitHub Action prepare is done.
