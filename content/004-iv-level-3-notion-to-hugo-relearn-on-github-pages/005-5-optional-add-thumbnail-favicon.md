A website can’t be at its finest without a thumbnail and favicon, what if I said that we can sync these images from Notion too, so good.


At the first line of your Notion page, create a “Toggle List” name “Custom Configuration”, inside it should have another toggle `thumbnail.png` and another toggle `favicon.png` add images you want to the corresponding toggle. [Sample here](/71a230664cf04e3cae7c1cecd2e6c465).

[FYI] You can use Toggle in Notion by typing `> space` at the start of the line.
