Diagram conventions:


```bash
Example:
EC2 - AWS - EC2 Private
Private IP - 10.10.1.x

Explanation:
- The naming convention is always: <Service> - <Service Name>
Sample: EC2 - AWS - EC2 Private => <EC2> - <AWS - EC2 Private>

- Other lines represent properties:
Sample: Private IP - 10.10.1.x => <Properties>
```


That's everything. Letâ€™s get started.
